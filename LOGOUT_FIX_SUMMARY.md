## 🔍 Debug Features Added

### Console Logging System
Every action now logs with emoji markers:

| Emoji | What it tracks |
|-------|---------------|
| 🔴 | Sidebar user actions |
| 🚪 | Logout function execution |
| 🗺️ | Navigator rendering |
| 🔄 | Auth state changes |
| ❌ | Errors |

### Example Output (Successful Logout):
```
🔴 [SIDEBAR] Logout button pressed
🔴 [SIDEBAR] User confirmed logout
🚪 [LOGOUT] Starting logout process...
🚪 [LOGOUT] Clearing AsyncStorage...
🚪 [LOGOUT] AsyncStorage cleared successfully
🚪 [LOGOUT] Verification - Token in storage: null ✓
🚪 [LOGOUT] isAuthenticated: false ✓
🔄 [NAVIGATOR] Auth state changed!
🗺️ [NAVIGATOR] Rendering AUTH screens
→ Login screen appears ✓
```

---

## 🧪 How to Test

### Quick Test:
1. **Open your app**
2. **Login** to dashboard
3. **Open Metro Bundler console** (where you ran `npm start`)
4. **Tap hamburger menu (≡)**
5. **Scroll to bottom** → Tap "Logout"
6. **Confirm logout**
7. **Watch console logs** - you'll see detailed flow
8. **Verify**: Should redirect to Login screen

---

## 🎯 What Gets Cleared

When you logout:
- ✅ JWT Token (`@brmh_token`) - **Removed from AsyncStorage**
- ✅ User Data (`@brmh_auth`) - **Removed from AsyncStorage**
- ✅ Auth State - **Set to `isAuthenticated: false`**
- ✅ Navigation - **Redirects to Login screen**

---

## 📋 Verification Steps

After logout, verify these conditions:

1. **Console shows:** `Token in storage: null` ✓
2. **Console shows:** `isAuthenticated: false` ✓
3. **Console shows:** `Rendering AUTH screens` ✓
4. **App displays:** Login screen ✓
5. **Cannot go back:** to dashboard ✓

## 🚨 If It Still Doesn't Work

### Check These:

1. **Is AsyncStorage installed?**
   ```bash
   cd BRMHMANAGEMENT
   npm list @react-native-async-storage/async-storage
   ```

2. **Is AuthProvider wrapping AppNavigator?**
   Check `App.js`:
   ```typescript
   <AuthProvider>  ← Must wrap everything
     <AppProvider>
       <AppNavigator />
     </AppProvider>
   </AuthProvider>
   ```

3. **Are you seeing console logs?**
   - Check Metro Bundler terminal
   - Not the app console

4. **Try clean install:**
   ```bash
   cd BRMHMANAGEMENT
   rm -rf node_modules
   npm install
   npm start --reset-cache
   ```
