# Task Creation Notification & Role-Based Access Implementation

## 📋 Overview

This document describes the implementation of WhatsApp notifications and role-based access control for task creation in the BRMH Management App.

## ✨ Features Implemented

### 1. **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**
   - ✅ Only **Admin** and **Manager** roles can create tasks
   - ✅ Regular users are blocked with a permission error
   - ✅ Clear error messaging when permission is denied

### 2. **WhatsApp Notifications**
   - ✅ Automatic notification sent when a task is created
   - ✅ Professional message formatting with emojis
   - ✅ Includes all task details (title, project, assignee, priority, dates, etc.)
   - ✅ Non-blocking implementation (task creation succeeds even if notification fails)

## 🔧 Implementation Details

### Files Modified

1. **`src/services/api.ts`**
   - Added notification URL constant
   - Added `sendWhatsAppNotification()` method to ApiService class
   - Formats task data into a professional WhatsApp message

2. **`src/screens/CreateTaskScreen.tsx`**
   - Imported `useAuth` hook
   - Added permission check using `canManage()` 
   - Triggers WhatsApp notification after successful task creation
   - Updated success alert to mention notification sent

3. **`src/components/CreateTaskForm.tsx`**
   - Applied same changes as CreateTaskScreen for consistency
   - Permission check and notification trigger

## 📱 WhatsApp Notification Format

When a task is created, the following formatted message is sent:

```
📢 *New Task Created*

🔹 *Task Title:* [Task Title]
🔹 *Project:* [Project Name]
🔹 *Description:* [Task Description]
🔹 *Assignee:* [Assignee Name]
🔹 *Status:* [Status]
🔹 *Priority:* [Priority]

📊 *Task Details*
- Start Date: [Formatted Date]
- Due Date: [Formatted Date]
- Estimated Hours: [Hours] hours
- Progress: [Progress]%

🏷️ *Tags:* [Tags]

✅ Please review and start working on this task.
```

## 🔐 Role-Based Access Control

### Roles Allowed to Create Tasks:
- ✅ **Admin** - Full permissions
- ✅ **Manager** - Can create and manage tasks
- ❌ **User/Member** - Cannot create tasks (read-only access)

### How It Works:
The implementation uses the `canManage()` function from `AuthContext`, which checks:
1. User's namespace roles in the database
2. Permissions for 'projectmanagement' namespace
3. Returns true if user is Admin or Manager

## 🧪 Testing Instructions

### Prerequisites:
1. Ensure you're logged in as a user with admin or manager role
2. Have WhatsApp configured to receive notifications at the endpoint

### Test Cases:

#### Test 1: Admin/Manager Creating Task
1. Log in as Admin or Manager user
2. Navigate to Create Task screen
3. Fill in all required fields:
   - Task Title ✅
   - Project ✅
   - Assignee ✅
   - Priority, Status, Dates, etc.
4. Click "Create Task"
5. **Expected Results:**
   - Task is created successfully
   - WhatsApp notification is sent
   - Success alert shows "WhatsApp notification has been sent"
   - Console logs show notification success

#### Test 2: Regular User Attempting to Create Task
1. Log in as a regular user (not admin/manager)
2. Navigate to Create Task screen
3. Fill in task details
4. Click "Create Task"
5. **Expected Results:**
   - Alert appears: "Permission Denied"
   - Message: "Only administrators and managers can create tasks..."
   - Task is NOT created
   - No notification sent

#### Test 3: Notification Failure Handling
1. Log in as Admin/Manager
2. Create a task (with notification endpoint unavailable)
3. **Expected Results:**
   - Task is still created successfully
   - Console shows notification error (but doesn't block task creation)
   - User can continue working

## 📝 Code Flow

```
User clicks "Create Task"
    ↓
Check if user is Admin/Manager
    ↓
    No → Show "Permission Denied" alert → Exit
    ↓
    Yes → Continue
    ↓
Validate form fields
    ↓
Create task via API
    ↓
Update local state
    ↓
Update parent task (if subtask)
    ↓
Send WhatsApp notification (async, non-blocking)
    ↓
Show success alert to user
    ↓
Navigate back
```

## 🔍 Console Logging

The implementation includes comprehensive logging:

```javascript
// Notification logs
📱 [NOTIFICATION] Sending WhatsApp notification for task: task-123456
📱 [NOTIFICATION] Notification message: [formatted message]
📱 [NOTIFICATION] Response status: 200
✅ WhatsApp notification sent successfully

// Or on error:
❌ Error sending WhatsApp notification: [error details]
```

## 🚀 API Integration

### Notification Endpoint:
```
POST https://brmh.in/notify/11d0d0c0-9745-48bd-bbbe-9aa0c517f294

Headers:
  Content-Type: application/json
  Accept: application/json

Body:
{
  "message": "[Formatted WhatsApp message]"
}
```

## ⚠️ Error Handling

1. **Permission Denied**: User-friendly alert with clear message
2. **Notification Failure**: Logged but doesn't block task creation
3. **Network Errors**: Caught and logged, task creation still succeeds
4. **Invalid Task Data**: Validation prevents submission

## 🎯 Benefits

1. **Security**: Only authorized users can create tasks
2. **Transparency**: Team members are immediately notified of new tasks
3. **Professional**: Well-formatted notifications with all relevant details
4. **Resilient**: Task creation succeeds even if notification fails
5. **Consistent**: Same implementation across all task creation flows

## 📊 Success Metrics

- ✅ Role-based access working correctly
- ✅ Notifications sent for all successful task creations
- ✅ No blocking errors for users
- ✅ Clear permission error messages
- ✅ Comprehensive error logging

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### Issue: User can't create tasks
**Solution**: Verify user has admin or manager role in `brmh-users` table with namespace roles for 'projectmanagement'

### Issue: Notifications not being sent
**Solution**: 
1. Check console logs for notification errors
2. Verify notification endpoint is accessible
3. Check network connectivity
4. Verify API key/endpoint URL is correct

### Issue: Permission check not working
**Solution**:
1. Verify user's namespaceRoles are properly hydrated in AuthContext
2. Check console logs for role derivation
3. Ensure user is logged in

## 📞 Support

For issues or questions:
1. Check console logs for detailed error messages
2. Verify user roles in database
3. Test notification endpoint separately
4. Contact development team with console logs
